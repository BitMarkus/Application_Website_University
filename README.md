# Application_Website_University
Application website for registering to an university course (in HTML/PHP/SQL)

This website was written in 2011 to apply to a new university course.  
I was only used for one year, because the application procedure has changed  
the year after. It is very old-school PHP. However, it still runs under PHP 7.3.7.
The website and all PHP comments are in German!

Using this website students could register for the university course. After editing
their personal data they received an email with a confirmation link. After klicking 
this link, the first step in the application process was done. Students could log
into a restricted area, where they could alter their data or to withdraw their 
application.

The university committee also had their own restricted area to view all applicants and their 
data ("Admin Login" link in the footer). Based on the students grades a number was calculated. 
In case that number was greater than a defined threshold, students were invited for
a personal interview. These appointments as well as the grades for the interviews could also be 
managed using the software.

Based on their grades from school and the interview, the software was 
determining if the student was accepted for the course.

The link for the administration area is in the footer (Admin Login). For login use
