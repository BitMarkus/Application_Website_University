# Application_Website_University
Application website for registering to an university course (in HTML/PHP/SQL)

This website was written in 2011 for a application of a new university subject. 
I was only used for one year, because the application procedure has changed in 
the year after. It is very old-school PHP. However, it still runs under PHP 7.3.7.
The website and all PHP comments are in German!

Using this website students could register for the university course. After editing
their personal data they received an email with a confirmation link. After klicking 
this link, the first step in the application process was done. Students could log
into a restricted area, where they could alter their data or to withdraw their 
application.

The university committee also had their own area to view all applicants and their 
data (Link in the footer). Based on the students grades a number was calculated. 
In case that number was greater than a defined threshold, students were invited for
a personal application talk. Application appointments and the grades the students 
got for their talks could also be managed using the software.

Based on their grades from school and the application talk, the software was 
calculating, if the student was accepted for the course.
