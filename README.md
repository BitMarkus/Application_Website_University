# Application_Website_University
Application website for registering to an university course (in HTML/PHP/SQL)

This website was written in 2011 for a application of a new university subject. 
I was only used for one year, because the application procedure has changed in 
the year after. It is very old-school PHP. However, it still runs under PHP 7.3.7.
